# Rock quality prediction model
### Introduction :
In this dataset we have multiple information about extracted rock, both geographical information and different material contents that are measured in the mine labs. If we can predict how much P2O5 (BPL_B) is in the ore without waiting for the lab results each time, we can help the engineers by giving them early information to take action. Hence, they will be able to take corrective actions in advance and help the environment. The objective is to build a strong prediction tool using EDA, supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.
